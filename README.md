# Vibe Check 💜  
*A culturally tailored dating app for HBCU students*

Vibe Check is a dating and social connection app designed specifically for students at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs). Unlike mainstream dating apps, Vibe Check emphasizes meaningful relationships and cultural alignment—celebrating shared values and experiences unique to the HBCU community.

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Apps like Tinder, Hinge, and BLK can feel overwhelming or inauthentic, especially for students like Ivy or Sarah—new to dating or seeking deeper connections.  
Our user research revealed:

- **90.7%** of HBCU students want *meaningful* relationships  
- **74.7%** prioritize shared HBCU experiences, majors, or interests  
- Many first-time users find large dating apps intimidating or untrustworthy

---

## 💡 Our Solution

Vibe Check simplifies and personalizes the dating experience with:

- ✅ **.edu email verification** for HBCU-only access  
- ❤️ 🙂 ❌ **Reaction-based matching** (romantic, platonic, uninterested)  
- 💬 **Limited concurrent conversations** to reduce fatigue  
- 🔍 **Interest-based filters** and matching via shared majors, values, and goals  
- 🌍 **Planned internationalization** and cultural customization
